            them carefully, as they govern your use of our platform for buying

          <h2>1. Seller Verification</h2>
          <p>
            As a seller on Social Press, you affirm that the accounts you list
            are genuine and that you are the sole owner of those accounts. Any
            false claims regarding ownership will result in immediate account
            termination and possible legal action.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Account Ownership Transfer</h2>
          <p>
            Upon successful sale of an account to a buyer, the seller
            relinquishes all rights to that account. The seller acknowledges
            that once the transaction is completed, they have no claim to the
            account and will not attempt to regain access or ownership.

            administrators detect any fraudulent behavior, including but not
            limited to misrepresenting accounts, coercing buyers in live chat,
            or any other form of manipulation, we reserve the right to block the
            offending account and add the user to our scam alert list.

            with stolen or otherwise illicit accounts. If you are found to be in
            possession of or attempting to sell stolen accounts, your account
            will be suspended or terminated immediately, and appropriate
            authorities may be notified.
